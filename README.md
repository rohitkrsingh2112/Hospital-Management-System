## BUSINESS LOGIC WITH PHP

### What Exactly Is Php?

    • PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor.
    • PHP is an interpreted language, i.e., there is no need for compilation.
    • PHP is a server-side scripting language.
    • PHP is faster than other scripting languages, for example, ASP and JSP.
           
### Why Use Php?
    • PHP is open source and free.
    • Short learning curve compared to other languages such as JSP, ASP etc.
    • Large community document
    • Most web hosting servers support PHP by default unlike other languages such as ASP that need IIS. This makes PHP a cost effective choice.
    • PHP is regular updated to keep abreast with the latest technology trends.


    • Other benefit that you get with PHP is that it’s a server side scripting language; this means you only need to install it on the server and client computers requesting for resources from the server do not need to have PHP installed; only a web browser would be enough.
    • PHP has in-built support for working hand in hand with MySQL; this doesn’t mean you can’t use PHP with other database management systems. You can still use PHP with
        ◦ Postgres
        ◦ Oracle
        ◦ MS SQL Server
        ◦ ODBC etc.
    • PHP is cross platform; this means you can deploy your application on a number of different operating systems such as windows, Linux, Mac OS etc.

## MySQL  DATABASE

	MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses. MySQL is developed, marketed and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. MySQL is becoming so popular because of many good reasons 

    •      MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.
    •      MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.
    •      MySQL works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.
    •      MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets.
    •      MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development.
    •      MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB).
    •      MySQL is customizable. The open-source GPL license allows programmers to modify the MySQL software to fit their own specific environments.
    
### SOFTWARES USED
  - XAMPP was installed on the Ubuntu 19.04 machine and APACHE2 Server and MySQL were initialized. And, files were built inside opt/lampp/htdocs/myhmsp
  - Sublime Text 3.2 was used as a text editor.
  - Google Chrome Version 77.0.3865.90 was used to run the project (localhost /myhmsp was used as the url).
  
## XAMPP:
  XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MariaDB (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes. Everything needed to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MariaDB), and scripting language (PHP) – is included in an extractable file. XAMPP is also cross-platform, which means it works equally well on Linux, Mac and Windows.
### Starting Apache And MySQL in XAMPP:
  The XAMPP Control Panel allows you to manually start and stop Apache and MySQL. To start Apache or MySQL manually, click the ‘Start’ button under ‘Actions’.
